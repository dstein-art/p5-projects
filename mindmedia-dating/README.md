# mindmedia-dating
 
This project is made up of two pieces:

1) build - this program will download about 1000 models from runwayml and create images for each of the results. (Move the images to the output directory). Then run the buildinclude.js > fileinclude.js in the directory that contains the images.

2) dating app - Created in P5, this is a simulation of a dating app where all of the images are fake people (Kind of like Facebook Dating). For this app to work, you will need to place all of the image files created from the build into an output folder. Then open index.html in a web server.
